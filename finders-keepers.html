        <p>Hi!  Look at you scanning random tags you found at DefCon.  On one hand this might not have been the safest decision you made this weekend but on the other hand you now have a shiney new RFID tag which you can program and use for whatever you like!!</p>
        <p>This drop was based on a project by TheHandsomeZebra aka Z. Their write up is available <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nfc.handsomezebra.com">here</a>, so head over there and give them some love.</p>
      <p>If you want to know more about me or chat about anything cyber, feel free to drop me a line using the info on the main page linked below.</p>
